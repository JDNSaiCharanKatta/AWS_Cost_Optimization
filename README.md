## Efficient AWS Cost Management through Stale Resource Detection

## Problem: 

<p> In cloud environments like AWS, developers often provision resources such as EC2 instances and associated storage volumes for various tasks. However, over time, these resources can become obsolete or unused, leading to unnecessary costs. One common scenario is when developers create EC2 instances with attached storage volumes and generate snapshots for backup purposes. When these instances are terminated, the associated snapshots are sometimes forgotten, leading to continued costs for unused resources.
</p>

## Solution:
<p>To tackle the challenge of inefficient AWS cost management due to stale resources, we've developed a proactive solution leveraging AWS services. Our approach involves implementing a Smart Lambda function that continuously monitors snapshots and EC2 instances. This Lambda function employs AWS SDKs to analyze the relationships between snapshots and active EC2 instances. If it identifies snapshots that are no longer associated with any active instances, it automatically triggers deletion actions, effectively eliminating unnecessary costs. By implementing this solution, we ensure that our AWS infrastructure remains lean, optimized, and cost-efficient, contributing to significant savings over time.</p>

## Note
<p> In the dynamic landscape of cloud computing, managing resources efficiently is paramount. One common oversight occurs when Elastic IPs are attached to EC2 instances for specific tasks. However, when these instances are terminated, the associated Elastic IPs are often forgotten, leading to ongoing costs. This oversight underscores the need for vigilant resource management to ensure optimal cost savings in cloud environments. </p>
